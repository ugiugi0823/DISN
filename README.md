## DISN: Deterministic Synthesis of Defect Images using Null Optimization<br><sub>Official PyTorch Implementation</sub>

![Figure 1](./fig/Figure1.jpg)
This repo contains PyTorch model definitions, pre-trained weights and training/sampling code for our paper exploring Deterministic Synthesis of Defect Images using Null Optimization (DISN) 




This repository contains:

* ü™ê A simple PyTorch [implementation](run.sh) of DISN
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Easy Data Augmentation Using our methodology [implementation](run_dataset.sh) 
* üí• Our LoRA weight [LoRA](./lora/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors)

## To Do

- [x] LoRA weight upload 
- [x] Create a Dataset Double 
- [x] Making long options in Various Defect Generation 
- [x] Image size 1024 version
- [x] Various Defect comparison tables


## Setup

First, download and set up the repo:
Code has been tested on Cuda 11.8 but other versions should be fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ugiugi0823/DISN.git
cd DISN
```

We provide an environment.yml file that can be used to create a Conda environment. If you only want to run pre-trained models locally on CPU, you can remove the cudatoolkit and pytorch-cuda requirements from the file.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate dune
```


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ If you want to see the demo like the picture below

| Original | Generated |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| ![Original](./fig/result_0.png) | ![Generated](./fig/result_1.png) |

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/run_1024.sh
```
It is very similar to the original, but with psnr numbers, you can create a completely different image.
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What if you actually wanted to double up your existing dataset?

```bash
bash scripts/run_dataset.sh

```
```bash
bash scripts/run_dataset_1024.sh

```
If you want to use your dataset, please modify the --original_dataset_path in run_dataset.sh.
Check results.txt later to check PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS score.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you want to see various defect like the picture below

| Original | Corrosion | Degradation |
|:--------:|:---------:| :---------:|
| ![Original](./fig/result_0.png)| ![Corrosion](./fig/corrosion_[0001]TopBF0.png) | ![Degradation](./fig/degradation_[0001]TopBF0.png) |
| Original | Peeling | Wear |
| ![Original](./fig/result_0.png)| ![Peeling](./fig/peeling_[0001]TopBF0.png) | ![wear](./fig/wear_[0001]TopBF0.png) |

| Text        | Image Size | PSNR $\uparrow$ | SSIM $\uparrow$ | LPIPS $\downarrow$ |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| peeling     | 512         | 28.16           | 0.941           | 0.042              |
| corrosion   | 512         | 29.35           | 0.949           | 0.035              |
| wear        | 512         | 30.31           | 0.953           | 0.043              |
| degradation | 512         | **31.68**       | **0.954**       | **0.027**          |




Try changing `--prompt` and `--ch_prompt`
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run_various.py \
--image_path "./img/[0001]TopBF0.png" \
--prompt "photo of a crack defect image" \
--ch_prompt "photo of a crack corrosion image" \
--neg_prompt " " \
```


```bash
bash scripts/run_various.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/run_various_2024.sh
```

As a result of changing to various prompts, you can see that it changes in a variety of ways compared to the original.
