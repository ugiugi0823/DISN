## DISN: Deterministic Synthesis of Defect Images using Null Optimization<br><sub>Official PyTorch Implementation</sub>

![Figure 1](./fig/Figure1.jpg)
This repo contains PyTorch model definitions, pre-trained weights and training/sampling code for our paper exploring Deterministic Synthesis of Defect Images using Null Optimization (DISN) 




This repository contains:

* ü™ê A simple PyTorch [implementation](run.sh) of DISN
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Easy Data Augmentation Using our methodology [implementation](run_dataset.sh) 
* üí• [Colab notebook](http://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/DiT/blob/main/run_DiT.ipynb) for running DISN



## Setup

First, download and set up the repo:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ugiugi0823/DISN.git
cd DISN
```

We provide an environment.yml file that can be used to create a Conda environment. If you only want to run pre-trained models locally on CPU, you can remove the cudatoolkit and pytorch-cuda requirements from the file.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate addib
```


## If you want to see the demo like the picture below
![Figure 2](./fig/Figure2.png)
```bash
bash run.sh
```




## What if you actually wanted to double up your existing dataset?

```bash
bash run_dataset.sh
```
